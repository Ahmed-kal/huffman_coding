# huffman_coding

Huffman coding is a text (sequence of characters) compression technique, in
which each character is assigned a binary code. The length of the binary code
depends on the frequency of the character. It provides a very efficient method of
compressing data. The resulting compressed file can range from 20% to 80% the size
of the original file, with the characteristics of the data being the biggest factor in that
matter Cormen, T. H. et al. (2009). Huffmanâ€™s greedy algorithm uses a table giving
the frequency of each character to build up an optimal way of representing each
character as a binary string.

This is an implementation of huffman coding compression using Java with a simple GUI.
